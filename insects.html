                About 10 years ago, I took a journey that would reshape how I see reality. It wasn't my first time with psilocybin, but it was the one that left the deepest mark.
            </p>
            
            <div class="dose-info">
                <strong>The Experience:</strong><br>
                21 grams dried Psilocybe cubensis<br>
                What they call a "heroic dose" - though that feels like an understatement
            </div>
            
            <p>
                I became miniaturized. Not metaphorically—I experienced myself as a tiny human in a world that had transformed completely. And that's when they appeared.
            </p>
            
            <div class="vision-section">
                <h2>The Beings</h2>
                <p>
                    Giant flying insects with capabilities beyond anything in our reality. These weren't the insects we know. They were:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Massive in scale relative to my miniaturized form</li>
                    <li>Shapeshifters—form was fluid, not fixed</li>
                    <li>Possessed of what I can only call "abnormal powers"</li>
                    <li>Seemingly intelligent, purposeful, guiding</li>
                </ul>
                
                <blockquote>
                    "It was like being in 'A Bug's Life' but directed by something far more alien. They were teaching me something through their movement, their transformation, their very existence."
                </blockquote>

                <h2>The Message</h2>
                <p>
                    What were they showing me? Even now, a decade later, I'm still unpacking it. But certain things feel clear:
                </p>
                <p>
                    They demonstrated that the laws of physics we accept aren't the only laws. Their flight wasn't just movement—it was a complete defiance of what we think is possible. Their shapeshifting suggested that form itself is more fluid than we imagine.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There was something about materials, about the structure of their bodies, that felt important. As if they were showing me that nature has already solved problems we haven't even learned to ask yet.
                </p>
            </div>

                <strong>Connection to Research:</strong><br>
                Years later, I discovered the work of Viktor Grebennikov, a Russian naturalist who claimed to have discovered anti-gravity effects in certain insect chitin structures. Coincidence? Or was I shown something real?
            </div>
            
            <div class="vision-section">
                <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
                <p>
                    I've had multiple heroic dose experiences. I've died and been reborn in those spaces more times than I can count. But the insect vision stays with me differently. It feels less like a memory and more like a blueprint.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As someone with roots in both Oaxacan medicine traditions and Silicon Valley engineering, I can't help but wonder: What if psychedelic visions aren't just hallucinations? What if they're glimpses of possible technologies, shown through nature's lens?
                </p>
                <p>
                    This vision won't let me rest. There's something here about biomimicry, about materials science, about the intersection of consciousness and technology that needs to be explored.
                </p>

            <p style="margin-top: 40px; text-align: center; color: #718096;">
                More explorations coming soon.
