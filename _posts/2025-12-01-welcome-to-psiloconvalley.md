This is psiloconvalley – my space for building tools in Go and connecting consciousness and code.

Right now I’m:

- Learning Go by building real tools (starting with an `.evtx` log decoder)
- Using this site as my lab notebook and launchpad
- Figuring out how to eventually turn these tools into products people actually want
