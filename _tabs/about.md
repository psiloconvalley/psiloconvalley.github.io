**psiloconvalley** started as a psychedelic idea about connecting consciousness and technology.

Right now it’s mainly:

- Me learning **Go** in public  
- Building small, real tools (starting with an `.evtx` log decoder)  
- Using this site as a lab notebook and launchpad

Long-term, I want psiloconvalley to be a place where:

- Developers find tools that help them think clearer and work better  
- Strange / “psychedelic” ideas about systems and consciousness get turned into practical software  
- Some of those tools are good enough that people are happy to pay for them

If you’re into Go, tools, or weird-but-useful ideas: welcome.
